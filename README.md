# Fraud-Detection-Analysis-Machine-Learning-Project
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to build a high-performance model capable of identifying anomalies and preventing financial losses.

🚀 Project Objectives

Understand transaction patterns using exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Preprocess and clean data to improve model quality

Handle class imbalance using oversampling/undersampling

Compare multiple ML models and choose the best performer

Evaluate model performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

🛠 Tech Stack
